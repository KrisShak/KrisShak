Hi, my name is Kristina!

My professional journey began as a software engineer, where I programmed in C++ and worked with SQL databases. Later, I became an educator in the field of virtual and augmented reality, which provided me with unique experience in teaching and developing innovative technologies.

The decision to become a tester is linked to my attention to detail and desire to improve the quality of software products. I see testing as an opportunity to combine my technical skills and experience with advanced technologies to create reliable and efficient solutions.
